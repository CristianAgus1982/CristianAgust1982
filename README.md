<strong>💡</strong>Bio Cristian </div>

Procurement Specialist & Data Analyst. With over 20 years of experience optimizing purchasing, contracts, and operations across sectors such as pharma, events, logistics, and promotional marketing. Passionate about efficiency, traceability, and cost analysis, I recently completed a Master’s in Data Analytics at Nuclio Digital, empowering me to turn complex data into strategic decisions. 

I aim to apply my expertise in negotiation, planning, and budget control to the design of dashboards, predictive models, and process automation.
